# k-means Alogrithm

Input
To run replace the current "myUniverse.txt" file with custom universe path or keep the same file.

current myUniverse file has first 5 Ci values of 'a', then next 5 Cis of 'e' and so on.
Initial yi values are taken as follows. Total Universe size is 250.
top 50 values centroid -> Class 0 
next 50 values centroid -> Class 1 
next 50 values centroid -> Class 2 
next 50 values centroid -> Class 3 
next 50 values centroid -> Class 4 

Output
Shows the Distortions after each iteration, utill 30 iterations or if the values converge before .
Finally shows the final words assigned to the classes.
Current file (myUniverse) has first 5 'a' then next 5 'e' ... and so on.
